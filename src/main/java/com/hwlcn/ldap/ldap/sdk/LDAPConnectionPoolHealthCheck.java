/**
 * This class provides an API that may be used to determine whether connections
 * associated with a connection pool are valid and suitable for use.  It
 * provides the ability to check the validity of a connection at the following
 * times:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Whenever a new connection is created for use in the pool, the
 *       {@link #ensureNewConnectionValid(com.hwlcn.ldap.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection)} method will be called
 *       before making that connection available.  The default implementation
 *       provided in this class does not perform any kind of processing, but
 *       subclasses may override this behavior if desired.</LI>
 *   <LI>Whenever a connection is checked out from the pool (including
 *       connections checked out internally for operations performed in the
 *       pool), the {@link #ensureConnectionValidForCheckout(com.hwlcn.ldap.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection)}
 *       method will be called.  The default implementation provided in this
 *       class does not perform any kind of processing, but subclasses may
 *       override this behavior if desired.</LI>
 *   <LI>Whenever a connection is released back to the pool (including
 *       connections checked out internally for operations performed in the
 *       pool), the {@link #ensureConnectionValidForRelease(com.hwlcn.ldap.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection)}
 *       method will be called.  The default implementation provided in this
 *       class does not perform any kind of processing, but subclasses may
 *       override this behavior if desired.</LI>
 *   <LI>The {@link #ensureConnectionValidForContinuedUse(com.hwlcn.ldap.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection)}
 *       method will be invoked periodically by a background thread created by
 *       the connection pool to determine whether available connections within
 *       the pool are still valid.  The default implementation provided in this
 *       class does not perform any kind of processing, but subclasses may
 *       override this behavior if desired.</LI>
 *   <LI>The {@link #ensureConnectionValidAfterException} method may be invoked
 *       if an exception is caught while processing an operation with a
 *       connection which is part of a connection pool.  The default
 *       implementation provided in this class only examines the result code of
 *       the provided exception and uses the
 *       {@link com.hwlcn.ldap.ldap.sdk.ResultCode#isConnectionUsable(com.hwlcn.ldap.ldap.sdk.ResultCode)} method to make the
 *       determination, but subclasses may override this behavior if
 *       desired.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * Note that health check implementations should be designed so that they are
 * suitable for use with connections having any authentication state.  The
 * {@link #ensureNewConnectionValid(com.hwlcn.ldap.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection)} method will be invoked on
 * unauthenticated connections, and the remaining health check methods will be
 * invoked using whatever credentials are assigned to connections in the
 * associated connection pool.
